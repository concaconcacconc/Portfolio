        <p>
           My name is Hieu, I am a sophomore students and currently study at AIEA Highschool and I want to shared to you guys my favorite element in chemistry since chemistry is my favorite subject.
        </p>
        
        <h3><b>Carbon</b></h3>
        <p>
            <b>What is Carbon?</b>
            Carbon (from Latin: carbo "coal") is a chemical element with the symbol C and atomic number 6. It is nonmetallic and tetravalent â€”its atom making four electrons available to form covalent chemical bonds. It belongs to group 14 of the periodic table.

        <h3><b>What makes Carbon speical</b></h3>
        <p>
            Carbon atoms are unique because they can <em>bond together</em> to form very long, durable chains that can have branches or rings of various sizes and often contain thousands of carbon atoms. Silicon and a few other elements can form similar chains; but they are generally shorter, and much less durable.
